# 49poker

A MERN Full-stack project application attempting to build a small portion of poker play.

## 

The primary idea was to build a game that can be played with a group of friends and for the site itself to
provide options on which rooms or tables the user wants to join based on the information he already has.
It tries to implement a subset of the game , with 2 users and a dealer who are provided with the hands drawn once they enter the room.

### Entity Relationships

The below diagram illustrates the relationship.
In plain words , a round of play holds many players and all the information related to them.
